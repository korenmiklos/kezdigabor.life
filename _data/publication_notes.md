# KÃ©zdi publications from MTMT
Aug 12 2021
By Gergely Attila Kiss

This version of publications contains 106 observations including book chapters, journal articles, working papers, reports and conference papers. My insight is that the book type actually means working papers. I have removed some rows form the original MTMT list of publications that were obviously listed several times as different item types. Mainly affected working papers in the list because if a paper reached publication, then it can be twice in the list once under book and once under journal article, kept the jorunal article. There were two observations that I added by hand to the list first is "Expectations, Aging and Cognitive Decline", second is "Low employment among the 50+ population in Hungary: the role of incentives, health and cognitive capacities"

## Papers not accessable with @ceu.edu 
There are some papers that I know has journal versions in online libraries but could not reach with my @ceu.edu email. The libraries are:
- Wiley
- ASA
- De Gruyter
- AEA
- Springer
- Taylor & Francis online

## Notes on categories
- yes: I find the given version
- no: I either did not find or find but could not download
- ?: I think this is a duplicate but with a somewhat different name
- x: I did not find anything on this row.

## Suggested actions
I think most of the rows with ? could be deleted while for the ones with x I think we should keep them without providing any links for the papers, they are mostly from the early 2000s and before.
