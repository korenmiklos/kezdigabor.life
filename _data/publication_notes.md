# Publications from MTMT
By Gergely Attila Kiss

This version of publications contains 106 observations including book chapters, journal articles, working papers, reports and conference papers. My insight is that the book type actually means working papers. I have removed some rows form the original MTMT list of publications that were obviously listed several times as different item types. Mainly affected working papers in the list because if a paper reached publication, then it can be twice in the list once under book and once under journal article, kept the jorunal article. There were two observations that I added by hand to the list first is "Expectations, Aging and Cognitive Decline", second is "Low employment among the 50+ population in Hungary: the role of incentives, health and cognitive capacities"
