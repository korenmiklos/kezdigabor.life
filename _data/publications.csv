The survey allows individual-level, quantitative estimates of risk tolerance and of the perceived mean, and variance of stock returns. These estimates have economically and statistically significant association for the distribution of stock shares with relative magnitudes in proportion with the predictions of theories. Incorporating survey measurement error in the estimation model increases the estimated associations 2-fold, but they are still substantially attenuated being only about 5% of what benchmark finance theories predict. Because of the careful attention in the estimation to measurement error, the attenuation likely arises from economic behavior rather than errors in variables.","2020","2021-08-03 09:13:55","2021-08-03 09:13:55","","633-646","","","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Household portfolio choice; risk preference; Subjective stock returns distribution; Survey measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standardized test scores as well as the fraction of students with competences considered inadequate are examined. Regardless of measurement and subject area, the bulk of the gap is explained by social differences in income, wealth and parental education. Using reduced-form regressions, two major mediating mechanisms are identified: first, on average the home environment of Roma children is less favourable for cognitive development; second, the educational environment of the average Roma student is different from the average non-Roma student. Comparing students with similar home environments from the same school and class, the ethnic gap in test scores is found to be insignificant. Ethnic differences in the home environment are explained by social disparity, and ethnicity seems to play no additional role in that regard. The unequal distribution of Roma students in schools and classes is found to be explained predominantly by social difference, too, with a significant residual portion, indicating the effect of ethnic segregation. © 2015 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2016","2021-08-03 09:13:56","2021-08-03 09:13:56","","135-162","","","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EDUCATION; Hungary; parenting; Roma; Test score gap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Látni fogjuk, hogy a fejlődés valójában alulról építkezik: a paneltípusú adatok megjelenése különböző problémákat hoz felszínre, amelyekre elméleti és módszertani újításokat adó válaszok születnek, s az újítások aztán visszahatnak újabb és egyre bonyolultabb adatbázisok gyűjtésére. Ez a visszacsatolási mechanizmus a legfontosabb mozgatórugója a jelenleg zajló, úgynevezett big data adatforradalomnak, amelynek eredményeképpen mélyebb s egyszerre átfogóbb és részletesebb képet kaphatunk a gazdaság egészének működéséről.

The method compares the behavior of already contracted consumers to the behavior of new consumers, the latter serving as a counterfactual to the former. In panel regressions on firms' incoming and quitting consumers, we look at the differential response to price changes and identify the lock-in effect from the difference between the two. We discuss the potential econometric issues and measurement problems and offer solutions to them. We illustrate our method by analyzing the market for personal loans in Hungary and find strong lock-in effects. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2013","2021-08-03 09:13:58","2021-08-03 09:13:58","","431-452","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","demand analysis; difference-in-differences; lock-in; personal loans; switching costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirikus elemzésünkben intézményszintű óvodai és településszintű demográfiai adatok tízéves (2001-2010) idősorára, valamint a Magyar Államkincstár 2009-2010. évi óvodáztatási támogatásra vonatkozó településsoros adataira támaszkodunk. Becslési eredményeink pozitív hatást mutatnak ki, a hatás mértéke azonban mérsékelt. A program elemeit értékelve, rámutatunk több olyan problémára és hiányosságra, amely felelős lehet a gyenge hatásokért. A becsült hatások ott a legmagasabbak, ahol az óvodai férőhelyek száma meghaladja a potenciális igényeket, és jóval alacsonyabbak ott, ahol nincs elegendő férőhely.","2012","2021-08-03 09:13:59","2021-08-03 09:13:59","","1045-1085","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A kompetenciamérések olvasás-szövegértési és matematikai teszteredményei alapján a nyolcadik évfolyamos roma tanulók lemaradása tekintélyes; éppen akkora, mint amekkora a hasonló korú fehér és fekete bőrű diákok közti különbség volt az Egyesült Államokban az 1980-as években. A lemaradások mögött nem etnikai sajátosságok, hanem társadalmi összetételbeli (jövedelmi, iskolázottsági és lakóhelyi) különbségek állnak. A roma tanulók társadalmi hátrányai - az egészségi állapot kisebb, de nem elhanyagolható szerepe mellett - döntő részben két közvetítő mechanizmuson keresztül válnak tanulmányi lemaradásokká: a roma tanulók otthoni környezetükön belül kevésbé jutnak hozzá a készségeik fejlődéséhez fontos erőforrásokhoz, iskolai pályafutásuk pedig rosszabb minőségű oktatási környezetben történik. A családi nevelési környezeti hátrányokat magukat is nagyrészt az életkörülmények alakítják. Az iskolai hátrányok nagyobb részét is az alacsony társadalmi státus magyarázza, de a roma tanulók esetében erre még további hátrányként rárakódik az etnikai szegregáció hatása is. Az eredmények alapján a szegénység enyhítése mellett megfelelően célzott és szervezett szakpolitikai intézkedések is enyhíthetik a szegény sorban élő roma és nem roma gyermekek lemaradását.","2012","2021-08-03 09:13:59","2021-08-03 09:13:59","","798-853","","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It uses a unique dataset collected through a firm- level survey conducted in 17 European countries and covering various sectors. Several conclusions are drawn from this evidence. Firms adjust wages less frequently than prices, on average every 15 and 10 months, respectively. Price and, especially, wage adjustment exhibit a substantial degree of time-dependence. In particular, wage changes tend to cluster at a specific time of the year, mostly January in the majority of countries. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that prices are more flexible when competitive pressures in product markets are strong and when labor costs account for a lower fraction of firms' total costs, whereas wages are more flexible when bargaining is decentralized and when the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Price rigidities are higher in firms with a larger share of high-skilled/white-collar workers.","2012","2021-08-03 09:14:00","2021-08-03 09:14:00","","772-782","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use data from the Health and Retirement Study that was fielded in February 2008 through February 2009. The effect of the crash is identified from the date of the interview, which is shown to be exogenous to previous stock market expectations. We estimate the effect of the crash on the population average of expected returns, the population average of the uncertainty about returns (subjective standard deviation), and the cross-sectional heterogeneity in expected returns (disagreement). We show estimates from simple reduced-form regressions on probability answers as well as from a more structural model that focuses on the parameters of interest and separates survey noise from relevant heterogeneity. We find a temporary increase in the population average of expectations and uncertainty right after the crash. The effect on cross-sectional heterogeneity is more significant and longer lasting, which implies substantial long-term increase in disagreement. The increase in disagreement is larger among the stockholders, the more informed, and those with higher cognitive capacity, and disagreement co-moves with trading volume and volatility in the market.","2011","2021-08-03 09:14:00","2021-08-03 09:14:00","","393-415","","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The employment rate of the Roma dropped dramatically around 1990. The ethnic employment gap has been around 40 percentage points for both men and women and has remained remarkably stable. Differences in education are the most important factor behind the gap, the number of children is important for female employment and geographic differences play little role once education is controlled for.
